  <p><h3><center><b><u>Harassment</u></b></center></h3>
  <p>Providing a safe environment in AFX Dance is our top priority. AFX Dance has a zero-tolerance policy with regards to harassment. Harassment of any kind may result in a permanent expulsion of membership in AFX Dance. Harassment is governed by state laws, which vary by state, but is generally defined as a course of conduct which annoys, threatens, intimidates, alarms, or puts a person in fear of their safety. Harassment is unwanted, unwelcomed and uninvited behavior that demeans, threatens or offends the recipient and results in a hostile environment for the recipient.
<br><br>
  Harassment includes the following categories of behavior:
<br><br>
  - Discriminatory Behavior: Discrimination refers to treating people differently, negatively, or adversely because of one or more of the following prohibited grounds of discrimination: race, color, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, documentation status, or pardoned criminal conviction.
<br><br>
  - Personal Harassment: Personal harassment includes objectionable conduct, comment, or display made on either a one-time or continuous basis that demeans, belittles, or causes personal humiliation or embarrassment on the part of the recipient. It may or may not be linked to discriminatory behavior.
<br><br>
  - Bullying: Bullying consists of behavior to attack and diminish another by subjecting the recipient to unjustified criticism and trivial fault-finding, humiliating the recipient (especially in front of others), and/or ignoring, overruling, isolating and excluding the recipient.

  <p><h6> CONTENT WARNING: Mention of sexual harassment and sexual violence </h6></p>

  <p><h3><center><b><u>Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence</u></b></center></h3>

<p>
Sexual harassment refers to any conduct, comment, gesture, or contact of a sexual nature, whether on a one-time basis or a series of incidents, that might reasonably be expected to cause offense or humiliation. Creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment through sexually inappropriate conduct is sexual harassment. Examples of behavior that can constitute sexual harassment include, but are not limited to: sexual assault, unwanted touching, patting or leering, inquiries or comments about a person’s sex life, gender-based insults or jokes causing embarrassment or humiliation, repeated unwanted social or sexual requests or invitations, inappropriate or unwelcome focus/comments on a person’s physical attributes or appearance.

Sexual violence is a physical sexual act engaged without consent. Examples of sexual violence include sexual assault, rape, battery, sexual coercion, dating violence, and stalking.

AFX Dance has a zero-tolerance policy with regards to sexual harassment and sexual violence. A dancer's membership will be at risk for expulsion/suspension in cases where there is doubt. If there is a report, a dancer's membership will be immediately suspended until the case is resolved. Immediate expulsion and blacklisting from the organization will occur if the accused party is found guilty in such cases.

AFX encourages its members to respect a survivor's wishes at all times in cases such as these.
</p>

Consent is voluntary, must be ongoing, and can be revoked at any point in time.
