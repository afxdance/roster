  Sexual harassment refers to any conduct, comment, gesture, or contact of a sexual nature, whether on a one-time basis or a series of incidents, that might reasonably be expected to cause offense or humiliation. Creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment through sexually inappropriate conduct is sexual harassment. Examples of behavior that can constitute sexual harassment include, but are not limited to: sexual assault, unwanted touching, patting or leering, inquiries or comments about a person’s sex life, gender-based insults or jokes causing embarrassment or humiliation, repeated unwanted social or sexual requests or invitations, inappropriate or unwelcome focus/comments on a person’s physical attributes or appearance.

  Sexual violence is a physical sexual act engaged without consent. Examples of sexual violence include sexual assault, rape, battery, sexual coercion, dating violence, and stalking.

  AFX Dance has a zero-tolerance policy with regards to sexual harassment and sexual violence. A dancer's membership will be at risk for expulsion/suspension in cases where there is doubt. If there is a report, a dancer's membership will be immediately suspended until the case is resolved. Immediate expulsion and blacklisting from the organization will occur if the accused party is found guilty in such cases.

  AFX encourages its members to respect a survivor's wishes at all times in cases such as these.
